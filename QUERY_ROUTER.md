> **Live run**: see the QueryRouter initialize a 1,720-chunk corpus across 50 topics and 333 sources on the [agentos.sh demo gallery](https://agentos.sh/#live-demo). Source: [`examples/query-router.mjs`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/examples/query-router.mjs).

[`QueryRouter`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/QueryRouter.ts) is the one-call grounded Q&A pipeline. Point it at your markdown directories, ask a question, get back a fully-attributed answer:

```ts
import { QueryRouter } from '@framers/agentos';

const router = new QueryRouter({
  knowledgeCorpus: ['./docs'],
  verifyCitations: true,
});
await router.init();

const result = await router.route('how do I configure a guardrail?');
//   result.answer          → grounded answer text
//   result.sources         → citations with title, URI, snippet
//   result.classification  → { tier, strategy, confidence, reasoning }
//   result.tiersUsed       → which tiers actually fired
//   result.fallbacksUsed   → e.g. ['keyword-fallback']
//   result.grounding       → per-claim verdicts when verifyCitations is on
```

## When To Use It

Reach for [`QueryRouter`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/QueryRouter.ts) when you're building any of these on top of a documentation corpus or knowledge base:

- An in-product help / "ask the docs" feature
- A support copilot that answers from internal runbooks
- An agent tool that needs to ground responses in a specific corpus before answering
- A test harness that needs reproducible classify-retrieve-answer triples for evals

It replaces the boilerplate of chunker + vector store + tier classifier + retriever + LLM call + citation collector with a single object whose `route()` returns a result you can hand straight to a UI. The result is intentionally provenance-oriented — the answer always comes with the sources it was drawn from, the tier path it took, and any fallback strategies that activated.

## How It Works

Each call to `route()` runs three stages in sequence:

1. **Classify** the query into one of four tiers (T0 trivial → T3 deep research) using an LLM prompt that sees the corpus topics, recent conversation history, and any registered tool names.
2. **Retrieve** the right amount of context for that tier — vector search for T1, HyDE for T2, multi-source decomposition for T3, nothing at all for T0.
3. **Generate** a grounded answer from the retrieved context, attaching `SourceCitation[]` entries that point back at the chunks the answer was drawn from.

If no embedding provider is configured, the router degrades cleanly to keyword search instead of failing. The platform-knowledge entries that ship with `@framers/agentos` (68 in the published package: FAQ, API reference and troubleshooting) are merged into your corpus automatically, with no extra configuration.

## What It Does

- Tier classification uses an LLM prompt with corpus topics, recent conversation history, and optional tool names.
- The router embeds local markdown docs into an in-memory vector store when an embedding provider is available.
- If embeddings are unavailable or vector search fails, the router falls back to keyword search automatically.
- `cacheResults` backs an in-memory `route()` result cache and is enabled by default.
- `verifyCitations: true` runs post-generation citation verification when retrieved chunks and embeddings are available; the verdicts land on `result.grounding`.
- Result metadata includes `tiersUsed` and `fallbacksUsed`.
- Lifecycle events cover classification, retrieval, research, generation, and route completion.

## Execution Paths

- Default path: `route()` classifies the query, then dispatches retrieval through the legacy [`QueryDispatcher`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/QueryDispatcher.ts).
- Opt-in path: if a host calls `setUnifiedRetriever(...)`, `route()` switches to plan-aware retrieval through [`UnifiedRetriever`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/cognition/rag/unified/UnifiedRetriever.ts).

[`UnifiedRetriever`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/cognition/rag/unified/UnifiedRetriever.ts) runs only after a host calls `setUnifiedRetriever()`; it is not the default retrieval path.

## Built-in Retrieval Branches

The graph, rerank and research branches have built-in implementations that use only the local corpus:

- `graphExpand()` adds chunks from the same document and with overlapping headings; it is not a GraphRAG engine.
- `rerank()` is a lexical reranker, not a cross-encoder.
- `deepResearch()` synthesizes from the local corpus; it searches no web sources.

Hosts replace any of the three with their own implementation through the hooks below.

## Host-Injected Runtime Hooks

You can replace the built-in heuristic branches without forking [`QueryRouter`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/QueryRouter.ts)
by passing host-provided callbacks in the constructor:

- `graphExpand(seedChunks)` for GraphRAG or relationship expansion
- `rerank(query, chunks, topN)` for provider-backed reranking
- `deepResearch(query, sources)` for real multi-source research

When these hooks are supplied, `router.getCorpusStats()` reports the
corresponding runtime mode as `active` instead of the built-in `heuristic`
mode.

## Example

Runnable source: [`examples/query-router.mjs`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/examples/query-router.mjs)

```ts
import { QueryRouter } from '@framers/agentos';

const router = new QueryRouter({
  knowledgeCorpus: ['./docs', './packages/agentos/docs'],
  availableTools: ['web_search', 'deep_research'],
});

await router.init();

console.log(router.getCorpusStats());

const result = await router.route('How does memory retrieval work?');

console.log(result.answer);
console.log(result.classification.tier);
console.log(result.tiersUsed);
console.log(result.fallbacksUsed);
console.log(result.sources);

await router.close();
```

### Host-Injected Runtime Example

Runnable source: [`examples/query-router-host-hooks.mjs`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/examples/query-router-host-hooks.mjs)

```ts
const router = new QueryRouter({
  knowledgeCorpus: ['./docs', './packages/agentos/docs'],
  graphEnabled: true,
  deepResearchEnabled: true,
  graphExpand: async (seedChunks) => [...seedChunks, extraGraphChunk],
  rerank: async (_query, chunks, topN) => chunks.slice(0, topN),
  deepResearch: async (query, sources) => ({
    synthesis: `Host-provided research for ${query}`,
    sources: externalResearchChunks,
  }),
});

await router.init();
console.log(router.getCorpusStats()); // graph/deepResearch/rerank runtime modes become active
```

## Bundled Platform Knowledge

The QueryRouter loads a bundled platform-knowledge corpus at startup and merges it into the corpus alongside your project docs, with no configuration required.

### What's Included

| Category | Count in the published package | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **FAQ** | 38 | "How do I add voice?", "What models are supported?", "Does AgentOS support streaming?" |
| **API** | 15 | generateText(), streamText(), agent(), agency(), embedText(), generateImage() |
| **Troubleshooting** | 15 | Missing API keys, model not found, embedding init failures |
| **Tools** | 0 | One entry per capability-catalog entry of the extensions registry |
| **Skills** | 0 | One entry per curated skill |

`npm run build:knowledge` adds the tool and skill entries only when `agentos-extensions-registry` and `agentos-skills` sit beside the package; the published package is built without them, so it carries the 68 FAQ, API and troubleshooting entries.

### How It Works

Platform knowledge is loaded from `knowledge/platform-corpus.json` inside the `@framers/agentos` package. During `init()`, these entries are converted to [`CorpusChunk`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/types.ts) objects and appended to the user corpus. Both the vector index and the keyword fallback index cover platform entries, so they work regardless of whether an embedding API key is available.

The platform knowledge layer sits beneath your project documentation:

```
User project docs     (your ./docs, ./guides, etc.)
  + Platform knowledge  (FAQ, API, troubleshooting; tools and skills only when
                         the corpus was built beside their registries)
  + GitHub repos        (optional — indexed asynchronously after init)
  = Complete corpus
```

An agent can answer questions such as "How do I add voice?" or "What messaging channels are supported?" without any project documentation: the published corpus holds FAQ entries for both.

### Agentic Credential Discovery

A key application of platform knowledge is **agentic credential setup**. The corpus includes dedicated FAQ entries for:

- **Gmail setup** (`faq:setup-gmail`): Step-by-step instructions for creating a Google Cloud project, enabling the Gmail API, downloading the `client_secret_*.json` file, and running the OAuth flow.
- **General credential setup** (`faq:setup-credentials-general`): The universal pattern for helping users configure any extension — discover what's needed via `discover_capabilities`, find files via `shell_execute`, parse them via `file_read`, and persist credentials.
- **Extension credentials reference** (`faq:extension-credentials`): Complete listing of what environment variables each extension requires (GITHUB_TOKEN, DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, etc.).
- **File discovery** (`faq:find-credential-files`): How to locate downloaded credential files on the user's system (checking ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop, ~/.aws, ~/.ssh).
- **Connect reference** (`faq:wunderland-connect`): Reference for the `wunderland connect <service>` OAuth flow, its supported services and the `--credentials` flag.

When a user asks "help me set up Gmail" or "I downloaded a credentials file", retrieval surfaces these entries, and an agent with tools such as `shell_execute` and `file_read` can follow them to guide the user through credential setup.

### Configuration

Platform knowledge is enabled by default. To disable it:

```typescript
const router = new QueryRouter({
  knowledgeCorpus: ['./docs'],
  includePlatformKnowledge: false,
});
```

### Regenerating Platform Knowledge

If you are contributing to AgentOS and need to update the bundled knowledge:

```bash
npm run build:knowledge
```

This regenerates `knowledge/platform-corpus.json` from the current tool manifests, skill registry, FAQ sources, and API documentation.

## Config Notes

- `knowledgeCorpus` is required.
- `init()` throws when the corpus is empty: no readable `.md` / `.mdx` sections under `knowledgeCorpus` and no platform knowledge (`includePlatformKnowledge: false`, or the bundled file missing).
- `availableTools` is optional and is only used to help the classifier reason about what the runtime can do.
- `apiKey` / `baseUrl` configure classifier and generator LLM calls. When omitted, QueryRouter prefers `OPENAI_API_KEY` and falls back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with the OpenRouter compatibility base URL.
- `embeddingApiKey` / `embeddingBaseUrl` override only the embedding path when vector retrieval should use a different provider or credential. When omitted, embeddings fall back through `apiKey`, then `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- `githubRepos` optionally enables non-blocking GitHub corpus indexing after `init()`. Newly indexed repo chunks are merged back into the live corpus, keyword fallback, classifier topics, and the vector index when embeddings are active.
- `deepResearchEnabled` controls whether the tier-3 research branch is attempted (by default, on when `SERPER_API_KEY` is set); the default core implementation is a local-corpus heuristic, and hosts can inject a web-backed implementation.
- `onClassification` and `onRetrieval` are hooks for consumers that want lightweight runtime integration without reading the full event stream.
- `cacheResults` controls an in-memory cache of completed `route()` results. QueryRouter clears that cache when indexed corpus chunks change and when retrieval-planning dependencies such as [`UnifiedRetriever`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/cognition/rag/unified/UnifiedRetriever.ts) or the capability-discovery engine are swapped.
- `verifyCitations` enables post-generation [`CitationVerifier`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/cognition/rag/citation/CitationVerifier.ts) runs against the retrieved chunks for a route. When verification runs successfully, the result is attached to `QueryResult.grounding`; if embeddings are unavailable or no chunks were retrieved, verification is skipped gracefully.
- `router.getCorpusStats()` returns a [`QueryRouterCorpusStats`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/types.ts) snapshot with configured path count, loaded chunk/topic/source counts, live bundled platform-knowledge category counts, whether retrieval is running in `vector+keyword-fallback` or `keyword-only` mode, the embedding health field `embeddingStatus`, and the runtime-truth fields `graphRuntimeMode`, `rerankRuntimeMode`, and `deepResearchRuntimeMode`.
- `embeddingStatus: 'active'` means the vector index initialized successfully, `'disabled-no-key'` means init stayed keyword-only because no embedding credential was available, and `'failed-init'` means embedding bootstrap was attempted but failed and the router fell back to keyword-only mode.
- `graphRuntimeMode: 'heuristic'` means the built-in same-document / heading-overlap expansion is active; `'active'` means a host-injected `graphExpand` hook; `'disabled'` means `graphEnabled` is off.
- `rerankRuntimeMode: 'heuristic'` means the built-in lexical reranker is active; `'active'` means a host-injected `rerank` hook.
- `deepResearchRuntimeMode: 'heuristic'` means the built-in local-corpus synthesis pass is active; `'active'` means a host-injected `deepResearch` hook; `'disabled'` means `deepResearchEnabled` is off.

## Result Metadata

[`QueryResult`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/orchestration/pipeline/query/types.ts) includes:

- `classification`: the final classification result
- `sources`: citations built from retrieved chunks
- `grounding`: optional [`VerifiedResponse`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos/blob/master/src/cognition/rag/citation/types.ts) from post-generation citation verification
- `recommendations`: optional skill/tool/extension suggestions inferred during plan-aware classification
- `tiersUsed`: the tiers actually exercised after fallbacks
- `fallbacksUsed`: retrieval/classification fallback strategy names such as `keyword-fallback` or `research-skip`
- `durationMs`: total end-to-end wall-clock time for classification, retrieval, and generation

## Events

The router records typed events for:

- `classify:start`
- `classify:complete`
- `classify:error`
- `retrieve:*`
- `research:*`
- `generate:*`
- `route:complete`

Hosts use them for observability and audit trails.
